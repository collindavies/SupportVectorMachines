# SupportVectorMachines
A few different tasks with support vector machines in R (markdown).

I recently completed a Statistical Learning course taught by Stanford professors Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani through EdX. 
Throughout the course, I applied what I was learning to analyses using R. 
This repo contains a summary of my work on support vector machines in R.
